# PowerShell SecretManagement Module Design

## Description

The purpose of the SecretManagement module is to provide secure storage and access of secrets, through registered extension vaults.
The registered extension vaults are PowerShell modules that conform to SecretManagement module requirements.
The extension vaults perform the actual work of authentication, and securely storing and retrieving secrets.
An extension vault can store secrets locally or remotely for a cloud based store.
Extension vault registration registers vaults for the current user context.
So, the SecretManagement module is essentially an orchestrator of extension vaults.  

The SecretManagement module provides commands for registering vault extensions, and accessing vault secrets.
This greatly reduces the temptation to hard code secrets directly into production source code, and instead use the SecretManagement module to dynamically retrieve secrets at runtime.  

### Using SecretManagement

```powershell
Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement

# See what extension vaults are registered for current user
Get-SecretVault

VaultName  ModuleName                        IsDefaultVault
---------  ----------                        --------------
CredMan    Microsoft.PowerShell.CredManStore False
LocalStore Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore  True

# Publish a module to the PowerShell Gallery, using a key from the SecretManagement default extension vault
Publish-Module -Path C:\Modules\Publish\MyNewModule -NuGetApiKey (Get-Secret NuGetApiKey -AsPlainText)

# Run management script on multiple machines, using stored credentials from the default extension vault
Invoke-Command -Cn $machines -FilePath .\MyMgmtScript.ps1 -Credential (Get-Secret MgmtCred)
```

The design is based on the [SecretManagement RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/208).  

## Supported secret types

Secret objects supported by this module are currently limited to:

- byte[] - Blob secret

- string - String secret

- SecureString - Secure string secret

- PSCredential - PowerShell credential secret

- Hashtable - Hash table of name value pairs, where values are restricted to the above secret types.  

## Vault extension registration

Extension vaults are registered to the current user context.
Information about the extension vault is collected via a registration cmdlet and information is stored as a json file in a user context based location.  

Example:

``` json
{
  "Vaults": {
    "CredMan": {
      "VaultParameters": {},
      "ModulePath": "C:\\Modules\\Microsoft.PowerShell.CredManStore",
      "ModuleName": "Microsoft.PowerShell.CredManStore"
    },
    "LocalStore": {
      "VaultParameters": {
        "DefaultLocation": "None"
      },
      "ModulePath": "C:\\Modules\\Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore",
      "ModuleName": "Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore"
    }
  },
  "DefaultVaultName": "LocalStore"
}
```

Validation checks are performed on each module before being registered.  

## Extension vaults

Vault extensions are PowerShell modules that provide five required functions

### Extension vault module required functions

#### Set-Secret

Adds a secret to the vault

#### Get-Secret

Retrieves a secret from the vault

#### Remove-Secret

Removes a secret from the vault

#### Get-SecretInfo

Returns information about one or more secrets (but not the secret itself)

#### Test-SecretVault

Tests that extension vault functions and returns True or diagnostic errors

### Script module vault extension example

This is a minimal vault extension example to demonstrate the directory structure and functional requirements of an extension vault module.
The extension vault module name is 'TestVault'.  

#### Module directory structure

./TestVault  
./TestVault/TestVault.psd1  
./TestVault/TestStoreImplementation.dll  
./TestVault/TestVault.Extension  
./TestVault/TestVault.Extension/TestVault.Extension.psd1  
./TestVault/TestVault.Extension/TestVault.Extension.psm1  

#### TestVault.psd1 file

```powershell
@{
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    RootModule = '.\TestStoreImplementation.dll'
    NestedModules = @('.\TestVault.Extension')
    CmdletsToExport = @('Set-TestStoreConfiguration','Get-TestStoreConfiguration')
}
```

The TestVault extension module has a binary component (TestStoreImplementation.dll) which implements the vault.  It publicly exports two cmdlets that are used to configure the store.
It also declares the required nested module (TestVault.Extension) that exports the five functions required by SecretManagement registration.  

Note that the nested module conforms to the required naming format:  
'[ModuleName].Extension'  

Note that only the 'NestedModules' entry is required because it loads 'TestVault.Extension' into the module scope, and allows SecretManagement access to the required five functions.
The 'RootModule' and 'CmdletsToExport' entries are only for configuring the TestStore in this specific case, and are not needed in general.  

#### TestVault.Extension.psd1 file

```powershell
@{
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    RootModule = '.\TestVault.Extension.psm1'
    RequiredAssemblies = '..\TestStoreImplementation.dll'
    FunctionsToExport = @('Set-Secret','Get-Secret','Remove-Secret','Get-SecretInfo','Test-SecretVault')
}
```

This nested module implements and exports the five functions required by SecretManagement.
It also specifies the TestStoreImplementation.dll binary as a 'RequiredAssemblies' because the five exported functions depend on it.  

#### TestVault.Extension.psm1 file

```powershell
function Get-Secret
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string] $Name,
        [string] $VaultName,
        [hashtable] $AdditionalParameters
    )

    # return [TestStore]::GetItem($Name, $AdditionalParameters)
    return $null
}

function Get-SecretInfo
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string] $Filter,
        [string] $VaultName,
        [hashtable] $AdditionalParameters
    )

    # return [TestStore]::GetItemInfo($Filter, $AdditionalParameters)
    return @(,[Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement.SecretInformation]::new(
        "Name",        # Name of secret
        "String",      # Secret data type [Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement.SecretType]
        $VaultName))   # Name of vault
}

function Set-Secret
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string] $Name,
        [object] $Secret,
        [string] $VaultName,
        [hashtable] $AdditionalParameters
    )

    # return [TestStore]::SetItem($Name, $Secret)
    return $false
}

function Remove-Secret
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string] $Name,
        [string] $VaultName,
        [hashtable] $AdditionalParameters
    )

    # return [TestStore]::RemoveItem($Name)
    return $false
}

function Test-SecretVault
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string] $VaultName,
        [hashtable] $AdditionalParameters
    )

    # return [TestStore]::TestVault()
    return $true
}
```

This module script implements the five functions, as cmdlets, required by SecretManagement.  

The Set-Secret, Remove-Secret, Test-SecretVault cmdlets write a boolean to the pipeline on return, indicating success.  

The Get-Secret cmdlet writes the retrieved secret value to the output pipeline on return, or null if no secret was found.
It should write an error only if an abnormal condition occurs.  

The Get-SecretInfo cmdlet writes an array of [Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement.SecretInformation] type objects to the output pipeline or an empty array if no matches were found.  

The Test-SecretVault cmdlet should write all errors that occur during the test.
But only a single true/false boolean should be written the the output pipeline indicating success.  

In general, these cmdlets should write to the error stream only for abnormal conditions that prevent successful completion.
And write to the output stream only the data as indicated above, and expected by SecretManagement.  

In addition, these cmdlets should perform proper authentication and provide errors, and instructions to authenticate, as appropriate.
Or prompt the user if needed, for example if a passphrase is required.  

A vault extension doesn't need to provide full implementation of all required functions.
For example, a vault extension does not need to provide a way to add or remove a secret through the SecretManagement cmdlets, and can just provide retrieval services.
If a vault extension doesn't support some functionality, then it should write an appropriate error with a meaningful message.  

## Vault registration cmdlets

The following cmdlets are provided for vault extension registration.  

```powershell
Register-SecretVault
Get-SecretVault
Unregister-SecretVault
Set-DefaultVault
Test-SecretVault
```

### Register-SecretVault

Registers a PowerShell module as an extension vault for the current user context.
Validation is performed to ensure the module provides the required functions.  

### Get-SecretVault

Returns a list of extension vaults currently registered in the user context.  

### Unregister-SecretVault

Un-registers an extension vault.  

### Set-DefaultVault

Sets one registered extension vault as the default vault.

### Test-SecretVault

Runs an extension vault 'Test-SecretVault' function and returns the test result.  

## Secrets cmdlets

The following cmdlets are provided for manipulating secrets.  

```powershell
Set-Secret
Get-Secret
Get-SecretInfo
Remove-Secret
```

### Set-Secret

Adds a secret to a specified vault.  
Returns True or False to indicate success.  

### Get-Secret

Returns a single secret for a provided name.  

### Get-SecretInfo

Returns information about each secret stored in all registered vaults, but not the secret itself.  
The information is returned in a `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement.SecretInformation` type.

### Remove-Secret

Removes a secret by name from a given vault.  
Returns True or False to indicate success.  

## Security

### Extension vault security

All extension vault module implementations are responsible for working securely.  
In addition each extension vault module is responsible for authentication within the current user context, and to provide appropriate informational and error messages to the user, including instructions for authenticating.
Extension vaults are also responsible for prompting the user for a passphrase, if needed, in interactive sessions.  

### Intermediate secret objects

The SecretManagement module makes a best effort to zero out any intermediate secret objects not returned to the user.
For example byte arrays used in storing and retrieving SecureString blobs are zeroed out after use.
But strings are immutable in C# and cannot be easily or reliably altered, and so must rely on the CLR garbage collection.  

### Plain text secrets

The SecretManagement module supports both `string` and `SecureString` secret data types.
To avoid inadvertently exposing these secrets as plain text, either in a command shell or logs, these secret types are always returned by `Get-Secret` as `SecureString` objects by default.
`Get-Secret` will return these data types as strings only if the `-AsPlainText` parameter switch is used.  

This behavior also extends to `hashtable` secret types.
Since hashtable entries can include `string` and `SecureString` data types, these appear in the hashtable as `SecureString` unless `-AsPlainText` switch is used.  

On Windows platform, `SecureString` types contain an encrypted version of the text data, using Windows DPAPI, that is keyed to the current user context and local machine.
But for all other platforms (Linux, macOS) this kind of default encryption is not possible so the dotNet `SecureString` type contains an unencrypted blob of the text.
However, `SecureString` still serves a purpose on non-Windows platforms, since it will not expose the plain text directly, and another dotNet API is needed to return the string contents in plain text.
So on non-Windows platforms `SecureString` still provides some security through obscurity (but not encryption).

### Extension vault module cross talk

SecretManagement extension vault modules all run in the same user context and within the same PowerShell session.
Since authentication is usually based on current user context, this means a malicious vault extension could harvest secrets from other registered vaults.  

This can easily be done by directly calling each registered vault secret management cmdlets.

One possible mitigation is for an extension vault to require a passphrase.
But usually the passphrase remains valid for a period of time (e.g., sudo), and the malicious extension vault can obtain secrets during that time.  

The best defense is to use known secure extension vaults from reputable sources, that are also signed certified.
